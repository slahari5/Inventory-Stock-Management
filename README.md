#Problem Statement

Developed a java application which has details about the inventory stock where the user can buy the items among three different categories. They are:
* Essentials
* Luxury
* Misc

Every category has a quantity cap limit on items that are purchased in single order. The items ordered should be validated whether they exceeds the existing stock count of inventory items. If the provided card details for payment doesnt exist, then the card value must be added to the database. When the user's request satisfies all the validations, a CSV file is generated with the details of successful order's invoice. 


# Design Patterns

* Singleton Design Pattern: This Design Pattern is categorized into creational design pattern and it restricts instantiation of a class to one object. This pattern helps in developing the database in application. A singleton InMemoryDB object is created and is stored as a static member which is accessed by all other classes without instantiating it everytime.



* Factory Design Pattern: This Design Pattern is categorized into creational design pattern which allows the subclasses to choose the type of objects to create. This design pattern says that just define an interface or an abstract class and let the subclasses decide which object to instantiate. it is used in generating the output after processing the order.
